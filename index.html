                <p>We're all familiar with the three Rs of preserving the environment (or at least we learned them from Captain Planet!): Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.
                However, if we've learned anything in the thirty-plus years since it aired, it's that we need to think outside the box and look at the whole picture of our consumption to be better stewards of the planet.
                <br />
                <br />
                Below, please find a simple guide to re-frame your thinking and see how we can better use the resources we currently have in abundance, without continuing to rely on overly-extractive methods of consumption.</p>

                <p>Think before you buy and be prepared to not buy at all. Green consumers place themselves at the start of the buy-and-use cycle. They buy less and buy products that do the least harm to the environment.</p>

                <p>Buy less, buy products that have little or no packaging and that last a long time, borrow instead of buy, and compost. Items that are no longer needed or used are donated or sold.</p>

                <p>Upcycle instead of throwing things away. Examples: glass jars can be used to store dry goods, old calendar pages are used as DIY envelopes, old toothbrushes are used to clean hard to reach places, empty toothpaste tubes are used as funnels. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/upcycling/" target="_blank">If you're looking for inspiration, check out the Upcycling Subreddit HERE.</a></p>

                <p>Try to fix items before disposing of them. Our current culture has been called a "throwaway society" because more items end up in the landfill than need to. This harms the environment and uses more of the earth's resources to make new items. We can help conserve the earth's resources by fixing things and participating in the "Repair Movement". <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/" target="_blank">For guides on how to fix TONS of devices and appliances around your house, please check out the iFixIt repair website here.</a></p>

                <p>When you regift, you give someone a gift that you received from someone else. Don't feel guilty! Passing it on to someone who will enjoy it more than you is a good thing. You just need to follow this etiquette: You are certain the gift is something the recipient would enjoy. The gift is brand new and comes in its original box. The gift isn't handmade or a family treasure A great resource for this - if you're not sure - is your local Buy Nothing Group! <a href="https://buynothingproject.org/" target="_blank">Learn more on their site here.</a></p>

                <p>Nature doesn't have a landfill - things that rot or compost in nature are food for something else! We can mimic that by putting things back into the waste stream to be used again for something else. Glass is used for roads, plastics are melted down to make new products, and the organic waste that we compost is used to fertilize our gardens.
